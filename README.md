# Unity Color Blindness Simulator

This repository contains a script and shader for simulating color blindness in Unity.

### Usage
First, clone the repository and open the project in Unity. Then, attach the Assets/Colorblind/Colorblind.cs script to your camera, and view the Game tab. The script contains a dropdown, which can be used to configure what type of colorblindness you are simulating. Deuteranopia is the most common.

To preview the behavior, the Assets/Colorblind/TestScene directory contains a scene with two cameras pointed at a color swatch. One of the cameras has Colorblind.cs attached to it, and will appear differently.
